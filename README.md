This is my take on the Tucows Technical Assessment.

## Setup

Install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm run dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
